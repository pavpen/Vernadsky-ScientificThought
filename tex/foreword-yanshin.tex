\section*{Preface}

The name of Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky has become widely known in our
country.  There is nobody with even the slightest degree of education, who
hasn't read, if not Vernadsky's works, then, at least, numerous newspaper and
magazine articles about him and his work.

There is a Vernadsky Avenue in Moscow.  One of the largest institutes at the
Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical
Chemistry,\footnoteRus{Институт геохимии и аналитической химии} bears his name.
There is a Committee for the Exploitation of the Scientific Heritage of
Academic V.~I.\ Vernadsky, which publishes its own circular, at the Presidium
of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  Branches of that Committee work in
Leningrad and in Kiev.  There have been grants under Vernadsky's name
established at Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and Simferopol University.  National
scientific centers for the study of the work of this prominent thinker and for
its application to the solution of contemporary problems exist in Odessa,
Rostov-na-Don, Erevan, Simferopol, Ivanov, and in other cities in the USSR, and
abroad---in Prague, Oldenburg and Berlin.\footnote{
